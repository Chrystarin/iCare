						<p>
								For thousands of years all kinds of species have walked the face of this earth. Out of all the species that has lived and strived on earth since life began, around 99% has already gone extinct. As of today, earth has gone through five major extinctions, and based on studies and research, we are currently living through the sixth. What makes it worse is that our current rate of extinction is brought about by our own human hands. Based on research, this current extinction that we are facing is much worse than all previous ones due to the much faster rate of species decline.
						</p>
						<p>
								Humans are, indeed, the most intellectual creatures that roamed the earth, which is not a surprise given that our intellect has brought us the most achievements and advancements throughout all species in this world’s history. But despite all the progress, natural resources are being depleted day by day in exchange for progress, success, and innovation. Trees are cut down for lumber and supplies, mountains are dug up for gems and minerals, animals are being hunted for their exotic parts, and for our exotic tastes, we veer away from ordinary livestock and satisfy our palates with the flavors of the “rare” and “limited”. For a species that already has everything, humans still hunger for more.
						</p>
						<p>
								Imagine an hourglass that is as heavy as the earth, its top vial filled with a million of singular grains of sand slowly dripping down to the lower chamber. Picture that every grain of sand is a family of birds, a herd of elephants, or even a swarm of butterflies that is slowly ticking away as they live helplessly in a world we built as helpless. We should be more responsible because extinction is something that we can never take back, as with an hourglass that cannot be flipped. Once it happens, once a species has gone extinct, there is no more turning back, and they are lost forever. It is not too late to bring a change to the world and save our biodiversity, because in the face of extinction, we are all at risk.

						<div class="Article-info">

							<h2>Dianne Chrystalin Brandez</h2>

						<img src="image/Blog/article2.jpg" alt="">
						<p>When we talk about saving the earth’s biodiversity, we imagine plans of grandeur like worldwide rallies to stop poachers from hunting animals and going on secret missions to shut down toxic factories that are harming the environment. We are here to tell you that you do not have to create worldwide-spanning organizations, or even be a top-class secret agent to save the world. As a matter of fact, you do not have to be anybody else. Just by being the ordinary you, can help us on the mission to finally save our biodiversity. There is a saying that the little things are what matters the most, yet it takes a single person to achieve big things, and to prove this saying, we follow these simple practices. </p>
						<h3>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h3>
						<p>Our species have taken more than enough from our natural resources and process them to all kinds of different products. Imagine the heaps of smokes and carbon emissions just from processing various items in exchange for wealth and conveniences. Now imagine what happens to all the garbage we end up producing after we use those products, where do they all go? Many garbage of plastics and such, drifts across the oceans and a lot of marine life mistakes them for food which then causes various illnesses and disease, or even worse, death. Forests are even taken down too in order to create landfills for a place to dump our thrash. How could we help solve this problem? The answer is being able to reduce, reuse, and recycle.  When you buy a bottle of water, don’t throw the plastic bottle just anywhere, instead you should think of ways to recycle it, if you can’t, then gather and donate them to the organizations who are dedicated to recycling them into new useful products such as plastic chairs.</p>
						<h3>Don’t Buy Exotic Products from Poachers! </h3>
						<p>Poachers are illegal hunters who hunt rare and endangered animals, or excessively hunts a certain species, just for their valuable parts and are sold out to the market for a terribly high price. Buying from these poachers just encourages them to do more. You don’t need an ivory necklace or a fancy animal pelt to show off your social status. A lot of animals are endangered because of these poachers, if we don’t entertain them and buy their products, then they wouldn’t have any reasons to continue their illegal and brutal hunt.</p>
						<h3>Lessen the use of Papers </h3>
						<p>We live in the digital age where in most of our documents are already digitized. This is a good thing because it helps us lessen the use of papers. Reducing the amount of papers you use can mean a lot in saving natural resources because producing papers requires lots of waters and trees. That is why if we cannot stop using papers, then at least reduce paper consumptions. </p>
						<h3>Spread Awareness </h3>
						<p>In a fast-paced modern world where everyone is always in a hurry, we are all so focused in our own personal stuff that many became ignorant of the current crisis we are facing. This is where you come in, just by spreading awareness of how much our biodiversity is in trouble will help shed light to an issue that is being ignored by the majority. You can spread awareness by recommend reading iCare articles to acquaintances, friends and family, for them to be enlightened regarding what kind of biodiversity issues we are currently facing.  </p>
						<h3>Self Discipline</h3>
						<p>If you read the things above, you might say that “oh this is quite easy” but maintaining and doing this at a constant pace is something that requires self-discipline. You will need to make it a habit, something you do every day, that it becomes a natural thing to do. It is a small thing but if everyone ends up doing it, then we can save a lot and bring about a big change in our world. </p>

						<h1 class="Article-title">The Disease Worse than the Dark Plagu</h1>

						<p>The Dark Plague was known to be the deadliest and darkest times when people were struck by an incurable disease that led to the death of thousands. Little did we know, there is a plague much worse than the dark plague, and that is the greed and selfishness living deep within the human heart. This disease did not only affect humans, but it has led to the destruction of many. Humans continue to feed, consume, destroy, more than what they need. We have become like a disease to our home called mother earth</p>
						<p>ASEAN is home to many countries that has rich and growing biodiversity compared to most regions due to the climate and many islands it contains. Unfortunately based on research, ASEAN biodiversity will greatly be eroded by 2100 if the destruction of the environment continues and is estimated to lose 70%-90% of habitat. This is caused by the overpopulation and the greed of capitalism. </p>
						<p>Now how is this disease deep within our hearts is worse than the dark plague? This is because the greed and selfishness eating away our compassion is making us do things that will one day bring about our own destruction. Our biodiversity is shrinking at an alarming rate, but no one seems to pay mind to it. Capitalists convinces us that there is no such issue occurring but no matter what we do, our sin will bite us in the end. Not only humans are affected by this, but all living beings on earth. It cannot easily be cured because changing the minds of people is no mere easy task.</p>
						<p>If we cannot control ourselves and our desires, we will face the wrath of mother earth. Climate change, starvation, global warming, these are just some of the possible consequences we could face. </p>

						<p>How nice would it be if humans and nature can co-exist peacefully, won't that be just a bliss? Unfortunately, due to the overpopulation of the human species, a lot of lands and forests are taken down to build homes for thousands of people. Because of this, animals have lost their own homes and either wandered off to the city and get captured by humans or die out of starvation. It's sad to think that for humans to have homes we must steal the homes of other species and animals. This is one of the major threats and causes why most animals are endangered and extinct.  </p>
						<p>We can learn from Singapore’s example, which is now considered the greenest city in South East Asia. They were able to integrate the co-existing of people and plants all together through exceptional architectural designs of buildings that are able to hold trees and plants without having any considerable setbacks. Countries should do their best to integrate these designs in order to create a healthy relationship between urbanization and biodiversity. Not only will this make the air clean, but it will also help people to maintain a good and positive vibe. As they said, people are happy when connected with nature.  </p>
						<p>A city of green won’t be just a mere dream anymore, through technology and research, anything can be possible. If we want to help create a city of green just like Singapore, then we must first start in our own homes. If we can all unite and do this together, then animals and plants won’t have to suffer for the sake of human progress.</p>
